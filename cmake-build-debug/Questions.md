## Question 1: Majority Element
Given an array nums of size n, return the majority element.

The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊n / 2⌋ times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,2,3]
Output: 3

Example 2:
Input: nums = [2,2,1,1,1,2,2]
Output: 2

Constraints:
n == nums.length
1 <= n <= 5 * 104
-109 <= nums[i] <= 109


## Question 2: Longest Consecutive Sequence
Given an unsorted array of integers nums, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]
Output: 4

Explanation: 
The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.

## Question 3: Linked List Cycle
Given head, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the next pointer. Internally, pos is used to denote the index of the node that tail's next pointer is connected to. Note that pos is not passed as a parameter.

Return true if there is a cycle in the linked list. Otherwise, return false.

Example:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/07/circularlinkedlist.png)
Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 1st node (0-indexed).

## Question 4: Remove Nth Node From End of List
Given the head of a linked list, remove the nth node from the end of the list and return its head.
Example:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/03/remove_ex1.jpg)
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], n = 2
Output: [1,2,3,5]

## Question 5: Kth Largest Element in a Stream
Design a class to find the kth largest element in a stream. Note that it is the kth largest element in the sorted order, not the kth distinct element.

Implement KthLargest class:

KthLargest(int k, int[] nums) Initializes the object with the integer k and the stream of integers nums.
int add(int val) Appends the integer val to the stream and returns the element representing the kth largest element in the stream.

["KthLargest", "add", "add", "add", "add", "add"]
[[3, [4, 5, 8, 2]], [3], [5], [10], [9], [4]]
Output
[null, 4, 5, 5, 8, 8]

## Question 6: Convert Sorted Array into Binary Search Tree
Given an integer array nums where the elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a height-balanced binary search tree.

Input: nums = [-10,-3,0,5,9]
Output: [0,-3,9,-10,null,5]
Explanation: [0,-10,5,null,-3,null,9] is also accepted:

## Question 7: Rotate Array
Given an array, rotate the array to the right by k steps, where k is non-negative.

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], k = 3
Output: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
Explanation:
rotate 1 steps to the right: [7,1,2,3,4,5,6]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [6,7,1,2,3,4,5]
rotate 3 steps to the right: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]

## Question 8: Two Sum
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].

## Question 9: Insert element in a Sorted List

Given a sorted linked list and a value to insert, write a function to insert the value in a sorted way

## Question 10: Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array

Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only once. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same.

Since it is impossible to change the length of the array in some languages, you must instead have the result be placed in the first part of the array nums. More formally, if there are k elements after removing the duplicates, then the first k elements of nums should hold the final result. It does not matter what you leave beyond the first k elements.

Return k after placing the final result in the first k slots of nums.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,1,2]
Output: 2, nums = [1,2,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).

## Question 11: Contains Duplicate
Given an integer array nums, return true if any value appears at least twice in the array, and return false if every element is distinct.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: true


## Question 12: Reverse a Linked List
Given the head of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return the reversed list.
